Images are labeled- "GOOD" images are for slowly moving meter needles, "BAD" images are for rapidly moving (i.e. blurred)
meter needles.    Where "GOOD" and "BAD" in the file name is followed by a digit, that represents a different run.
Each run had a slightly different meter orientation in the image frame.
